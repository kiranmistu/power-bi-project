# power-bi-project

This project showcases an interactive mobile sales dashboard created in Power BI, designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of sales data.  The dashboard features a clean and intuitive layout, highlighting key metrics like Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Sales (769M), Total Quantity sold (19K), the total number of Transactions (4K), and the Average Price per unit (40.11K). It includes a geographical map visualizing sales distribution across various cities in India, such as Ludhiana, Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai.  The dashboard further breaks down sales performance by brand (Apple, OnePlus, Samsung, Vivo), mobile model (iPhone SE, OnePlus Nord, Galaxy Note 20), payment method (Debit Card, Credit Card, Cash), and day of the week.  Notably, the "Auto Recovery" dialog box is captured, showcasing Power BI's data recovery capabilities and options for handling unsaved recovered files.  This project demonstrates the power of Power BI in transforming raw sales data into actionable insights for informed decision-making.
